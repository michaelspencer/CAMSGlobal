    - "Philsinports:  Seaports Operations"
    - "Active in Saudi Arabia since 1976, CAMS has initiated a number of projects that have set performance records and played major roles in the developmental efforts of the Saudi Government.  In 1977, as Managing Partner of Mansour Group, CAMS was instrumental in the establishment of Philsinports Corp. (Philippines-Singapore Ports Corporation), a joint venture between Mansour Group, SNAS, and the LandOil Group of the Philippines and Singapore Ports Authority.  That consortium took over a five-year port operations contract (stevedoring) for Jubail, Gizan and Jeddah. The result was elimination of severe seaport congestion that existed at that time, saving the Saudi government some two billion dollars per year in demurrage charges alone in the mid 70\xE2\x80\x99s.   Philsinports Corp. generated gross turnover of $700M per anum over its five year contract term.    \r\n\
