    - FAQ Page
    - "<ul>\r\n\
      \r\n  <li><p><strong>What determines CAMS role as an advisory service versus equity participant?</strong></p>\r\n  <p>In the case of public tenders, CAMS acts as an advisor or consultant to its client who bids for the project.    In the case of self-initiated privately funded projects, CAMS takes a percentage of equity for its role in the project.</p></li>\r\n\
      \r\n  <li><p><strong>Does CAMS operate as a UK company in the host country?</strong></p>\r\n  <p>That CAMS is based in the UK is advantageous, as much of Africa observes Anglo-Saxon law.  However, CAMS often establishes local subsidiaries, Special Purpose Companies or appoints local representatives in countries where it is executing a project.</p></li>\r\n\
      \r\n  <li><p><strong>Where does CAMS draw its human resources?</strong></p>\r\n  <p>Largely from among the nationals of the countries in which it operates.  CAMS recruits technical expertise as needed from consultants in the field and has many longstanding relationships of this nature.</p></li> \r\n\
      \r\n  <li><p><strong>Why does CAMS succeed in markets that are traditionally very difficult for multi-nationals?</strong></p>\r\n  <p>Through its long experience in working in such markets, CAMS is familiar with the local business customs and how best to obtain the support of the decisionmakers in order to conclude the business in question successfully.</p></li>\r\n\
      \r\n  <li><p><strong>Does CAMS invest its own money?</strong></p>\r\n  <p>CAMS advisory services are fee based.  CAMS may also invest in projects where it has equity interest.</p></li> \r\n\
      \r\n <li> <p><strong>What are regions of opportunity?</strong></p>\r\n  <p>Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly Tanzania, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda, are of particular interest because of their large demographics and pressing infrastructure requirements.  Additionally, these countries have  a supportive business environments. </p>  \r\n <p>We are also active in Central and Latin America, with particular interest in Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela, Costa Rica and Panama.</p></li>\r\n\
      \r\n  <li><p><strong>What are sectors of opportunity?</strong></p>\r\n  <p>Agriculture, Biofuels, Power Generation and Distribution, Housing, Health and Financial Services are sectors that have experienced tremendous growth in the developing world and will only continue to expand further.</p></li>\r\n\
      \r\n \r\n\
      \r\n  <li><p><strong>How has the financial crisis impacted CAMS ability to do structured deals?</strong></p>\r\n  <p>Many of the international players have withdrawn or re-cast themselves in light of the new capital environment.  However, African banks were largely unexposed to the financial crisis.  Monies from international organizations earmarked for young African democracies must be allocated or withdrawn.  The crisis has cleared the field for serious companies with solid projects. </p></li>\r\n\
      \r\n  <li><p><strong>Does CAMS work with NGOs and other international groups to facilitate projects?</strong></p>\r\n  <p>CAMS has worked with NGOs, sovereign funds and other international groups to attain structured financing or project funding.</p></li>\r\n\
      \r\n  <li><p><strong>Does CAMS comply with the Foreign Corrupt Services Act?</strong></p>\r\n  <p> Yes.</p></li>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \r\n   <li><p><strong>Can CAMS advise on inter-country tax and financial planning considerations?</strong></p>\r\n   <p>Yes, in consultation with tax and financial experts with whom it works.</p></li>\r\n\

      Active in Saudi Arabia since 1976, CAMS has initiated a number of projects that have set performance records and played major roles in the developmental efforts of the Saudi Government.  In 1977, as Managing Partner of Mansour Group, CAMS was instrumental in the establishment of Philsinports Corp. (Philippines-Singapore Ports Corporation), a joint venture between Mansour Group, SNAS, and the LandOil Group of the Philippines and Singapore Ports Authority.  That consortium took over a five-year port operations contract (stevedoring) for Jubail, Gizan and Jeddah. The result was elimination of severe seaport congestion that existed at that time, saving the Saudi government some two billion dollars per year in demurrage charges alone in the mid 70\xE2\x80\x99s.   Philsinports Corp. generated gross turnover of $700M per anum over its five year contract term.    \r\n"

      CAMS has exclusive rights for Proprietary ASSF (Advanced Solid State Fermentation) Technology. The technology, developed at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. by Prof. Shi-Zhong Li, was initially introduced at the Houston International Sorghum Conference August of 2008 with sponsorship of USDA.  The introduction included a protocol signature between China and the United States making the technology available for US production of ethanol, and other biomass bi-products, from sweet sorghum stalks.   The edible sorghum grains are returned to the farmers and local community as food or animal feedstock; or sold on their behalf.  ASSF was introduced by CAMS to African and foreign delegates of the First BioFuels Market Conference for East Africa, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania in September 2008.</p>
      
      <p>In March 2009, CAMS, in joint presentation with Prof. Li, introduced ASSF Technology to World BioFuels Congress in Belgium to wide interest. The system provides a simple, economical solution to the production of ethanol from sweet sorghum stalks, surpassing the cost-benefits of any available alternative.  ASSF ethanol production is viable with oil prices as low as $45 per barrel.  Conversely, the latest EU Report states that European ethanol is only cost effective when oil prices exceed $115 per barrel. ASSF fermentation takes 24 hours versus 56 hours for corn fuelstock.  CAMS is also now actively promoting the ASSF Technology outside of Africa. </p>
      
      <p>Maison Engineering China has been selected by Tsinghua University and CAMS to undertake complete design, engineering, construction and turnkey installation of the plant which has now been completed. </p>
      
      <p>An African Pilot Project is being planned for Tanzania to process and produce ethanol and power from sweet sorghum stalks  using ASSF Technology.  CAMS will long-lease 2,000 hectares of agricultural land to grow sweet sorghum, producing 10,000 tons (ten million liters) of ethanol per harvest, and generating 18 million KWh electricity, 80% of which will be dedicated to Rural Electrification.  In addition, other bi-products include organic fertilizer, animal feed and briquettes for  cooking fuel, a chronic contributor to deforestation and CO2 emissions. </p>
      
      <p>Sweet sorghum has been growing in Africa for over 5000 years.  Unlike corn or sugar cane, it does not require irrigation and can yield two harvests a year.  With irrigation, three or four harvests are possible. Because sweet sorghum also grows in Florida and southern US states, several companies in United States have indicated interest in the ASSF Technology, </p>

      <p>By Leigh Phillips</p>\r\n \r\n\
      <p>UK-based Sun Biofuels has secured land in Ethiopia and Mozambique for the cultivation of biofuels produced from jatropha, as well as some 5,500 hectares in Tanzania for the same purpose.  Britain's CAMS Group has also long-leased 45,000 hectares for biofuel development in Tanzania. </p>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      <p>Food production meanwhile is usually the focus of the land acquisition by emerging economies. The UAE has secured some 378,000 hectares to grow corn, alfalfa, wheat, potatoes and beans, while Saudi Arabia is in the process of gaining access to 500,000 hectares in Tanzania.  </p>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      <p>Some emerging economies as well are also getting in on the biofuels bonanza. China has secured a whopping 2.8 million hectares in the Democratic Republic of Congo for oil palm and is hoping to access another 2 million hectares in Zambia for jatropha.</p>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      <p>All told, the acreage secured through lease or purchase by Asian and European private and public investors amounts to 15-20 million hectares, at a cost of \xE2\x82\xAC15-20 billion ($20-30 bn).  By comparison, annual net official development aid by OECD countries amounted to around \xE2\x82\xAC90 billion ($120bn) in 2008, \xE2\x82\xAC50 billion of which came from the EU.\r\n\

      <h2>REUTERS:  UK Firm Eyes Ethanol Plant in Tanzania </h2>
      
      <p>DAR ES SALAAM - British-based energy firm CAMS Group plans to produce 240 million litres of ethanol a year from sweet sorghum in Tanzania at a cost of up to US$600 million, its chief executive said. </p>
      
      <p>CAMS Group, which was set up in the United States in 1972, has worked in sectors including telecom, transport and oilfield services. The project in this East African country is its first foray into biofuel production. </p>
      
      <p>George Joannou, the company's chairman, said it had acquired 45,000 hectares of land in two districts -- Handeni and Bagamoyo -- north of the commercial capital Dar es Salaam. 
      "The project is projected to be up and running in three years," he told Reuters late on Thursday on the sidelines of a regional biofuels conference. </p>
      
      <p>He added that his company would raise the funds through equity financing and from a leading commercial bank in London. Rising global fuel prices and fears over carbon dioxide emissions that spur global warming have led investors to turn to clean energy sources like biofuels. Many are looking at Africa. </p>
      
      <p>LOCAL FARMERS </p>
      
      <p>CAMS Group, which is operating locally as CAMS Agri-Energy Tanzania, said it would enlist the help of between 40,000 and 60,000 farmers to grow sweet sorghum. </p>
      
      <p>The project will run in eight villages on land leased by CAMS Group that is now untended. 
      The villagers already grow sweet sorghum in small quantities, Joannou said. Working with the Tanzanian Seed Authority and ICRISAT, an Indian NGO, the company intends to provide the farmers sweet sorghum seeds and other requirements to cultivate it. </p>
      
      <p>Sweet sorghum, which is similar to grain sorghum, has a tall stalk that can be turned into ethanol without damaging the food grain growing on top. The crop thrives in arid areas, making it suitable for many parts of Africa. 
      Joannou said the Chinese technology -- known as Advanced Solid State Fermentation -- would let the company set up fermentation and distillation plants in each village, and then transport the ethanol by truck. 
      It was aiming to produce 240 million litres a year, he said. </p>
      
      <p>The firm plans to generate 115 megawatts of power, which will be fed into Tanzania's national grid, and to produce carbon dioxide for use by firms like drinks makers. (Editing by Clarence Fernandez) </p>

      <h2>Posta Uganda-Cash4Africa Sign Implementation Protocol for Transactional Platform</h2>
      
      <p>Kampala, Uganda- CAMS represented Cash4Africa in pre-qualification and award of installation of their proprietary transactional platform in Posta Uganda's 300 urban and rural post offices throughout the country.  The platform will allow a broad range of services to be performed at the post offices, including money transfers, bill payments, wage payments and other services.  </p>
      
      <p>CAMS CEO Christopher Jannou worked with the Ministry of Information, Communication and Technology, under whose jurisdiction lies Posta Uganda, to introduce the technology platform, which Cash4Africa CEO Colin Vickerie projects will process upwards of 8 million transactions in Uganda within the first 12 months.  
      
      <p>"Posta Uganda is a great asset vastly underutilized", Jannou said, 'It has the confidence of the general public as a trusted institution of the state.  Posta Uganda will become a one-stop shop for all transactional services in Uganda, something badly needed in remote rural areas, particularly."  Implementation is expected to be completed by December 2009.  A broad advertising and awareness campaign will be developed to make the new services known to the public.</p>
